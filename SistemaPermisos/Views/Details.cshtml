@* This file seems to be a generic placeholder and is not explicitly used by any controller.
   It's better to have specific Details views for each model (e.g., Permisos/Details.cshtml, Omisiones/Details.cshtml, Reportes/Details.cshtml).
   Keeping it here for completeness based on previous context, but it might not be necessary. *@

    ViewData["Title"] = "Details";

        @* This view would typically iterate over model properties using reflection or be strongly typed.
           Since it's dynamic, it's hard to provide specific content without knowing the exact model. *@
